         <h1><u><b> <i>  The Ten Rings  </i></b> </u></h1>
         
         <p> The Ten Rings is a fictional organization in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It is a clandestine criminal organization founded one thousand years ago by the immortal warlord Xu Wenwu and named after his mystical ten rings. An original creation for the MCU, the group's name is an homage to the Mandarin's ten cosmic rings in the Marvel Comics.[1]

        <p>The Ten Rings are a secret society that built their principles around the Wellspring of Power. Ironheart became their first target where she is ambushed by two assassins that were empowered by the Wellspring of Power. They wanted Ironheart to give in to her power only so Ironheart would attack them. They vanish after the fight.[20]</p>
 
        <p>The Ten Rings was formed a thousand years ago in Ancient China by Wenwu, who found the Ten Rings that gave him great power. He used the Rings to conquer and forged the Ten Rings into an organization that had for centuries directed the world's history from the shadows. While searching for mythical Ta Lo, Wenwu encountered Ying Li. He fell in love and started a family with her, putting aside the Rings and settling down. This emboldened his enemies, and one day the Iron Gang attacked Wenwu's compound, killing his wife. Overcome with grief, he put the Rings back on and waged vengeance on his enemies.[1]

            Stark Industries' second in command, Obadiah Stane illegally sold the Ten Rings cell in the Middle-East Stark weapons to help them achieve their goals. Stane later made a deal with them: they would kidnap Stark Industries' CEO Tony Stark, force him to create a Jericho missile and then kill him, allowing Obadiah to take over the control of Stark Industries.
            
            After weeks in captivity, Stark created a suit of armor powered by the new invention of a miniaturized arc reactor, rather than the weapon he was tasked to build, and successfully escaped. Stark subsequently designed and built a far more sophisticated suit after his return to the United States, and attacked various camps of the Ten Rings, destroying the stolen Stark Industries weapons. Days later, the Ten Rings found the rest of the armor Stark used in his desert escape and informed Stane about it. Ten Rings' commander Raza proposed a deal with Obadiah Stane: he would give Stane the armor free of charge only if Stane supplied him with an army of iron soldiers. Obadiah refused, instead paralyzing Raza and taking the suit. Stane's men then executed the remaining Ten Rings soldiers.[2]
